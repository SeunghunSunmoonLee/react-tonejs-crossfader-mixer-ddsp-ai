Turning everdays environmental sounds into before unheard soundscapes.
Changing the perception of our environment by breaking its patterns and transforming them into a new hearing experience by using AI technology.

Finding a new way to capture the unique atmosphere of a place, turning noises into instrumental sounds and by that creating an additional level of sensual experience.

Finding the right sources = field recordings from different environments

Unmix the field recordings & create 4 separate stems for each

Using DDSP Timbre Transfer\* (pre-trained and own trained models)
